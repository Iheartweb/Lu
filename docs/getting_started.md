# Getting Started

## Introduction

Lu is a library that leverages semantics to describe interaction. This allows HTML authors to write rich interfaces without writing javascript.

Lu comes with a growing set of components. Each represents a building block of interactivity and is usually bound to markup through the use of a `data-lu` attribute. Components can be mixed, matched, rearranged, and re-purposed to build a wide variety of interfaces.

This guide will describe the steps needed to create a tabbed interface starting with getting Lu on your page, to configuring components and wiring them together. But, before we write HTML we need download the necessary dependencies.

Lu leverages a toolkit that includes: jQuery, underscore, inject, and Fiber.
